# Aetherlight tools
Unofficial tools developed in python for the [Aetherlight: Chronicles of the Resistance](https://theaetherlight.com/).

These programs should work on any Windows computer. 
It would be appreciate if you could develop a MacOS and Linux version of each file.
Please report any and all problems to [Issues](https://github.com/Hans0ddcraft/Aetherlight-tools/issues) and check the [wiki](https://github.com/Hans0ddcraft/Aetherlight-tools/wiki) for instructions on installation and info.
The 'Friends' program is still in beta and any help in development would be helpful.
